# Define a BankAccount class with the following fields:
# (1) holder_name
# (2) account_no
# (3) current_balance

# The value to each field needs to be provided when an instance of BankAccount is created.
# Write code to create an instance of BankAccount




# Write code to print the details of the bank account



# How would you change the __init__ method so that by the current_balance is an
# optional argument with a default value of 10 indicating that amount is needed to create
# a bank account? Recall optional argument in function definition?

# Once done, create another instance of BankAccount with only holder's name and 
# account number, and then print the all details of the new instance.
