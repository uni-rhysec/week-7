# Create a Character class with the following fields:
# (1) name - the name of the character
# (2) health - the health of the character, with value between 0 to 100
# (3) attack_power - the attack power of the character, with value between 10 to 100

# When an instance of Character is created, the value to all three fields are required.





# Once completed, create two instances of Character to two of your most favourite game characters.
# Then, write code to print the details of each character.



# How would you change the __init__ function so that by default the health is 100
# and attack_power is 10.
